Rebuild the `codegraphy` CLI and MCP server around path-first CodeGraphy Workspace commands backed by `@codegraphy/core`. CLI and MCP indexing/query tools now default to the current folder or accept an explicit workspace path, and no longer need to open, select, or focus VS Code.

Add matching CLI and MCP plugin commands for refreshing, adding, listing, enabling, and disabling CodeGraphy plugin packages.
