# `@codegraphy/plugin-markdown`

Headless CodeGraphy plugin for Markdown and Obsidian-style wikilinks.

This package exposes the Markdown plugin runtime used by `@codegraphy/core`. It detects wikilinks such as `[[Note]]`, `[[folder/Note|Alias]]`, and `![[Embed]]`, then emits Relationship Graph references between workspace files.

## CodeGraphy Metadata

The package declares `package.json#codegraphy` metadata so CodeGraphy can discover and validate the plugin without importing runtime code. Runtime loading happens during explicit Indexing.
