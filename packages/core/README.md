# `@codegraphy/core`

Shared CodeGraphy engine package for workspace indexing, Graph Cache access, and Graph Query behavior.

This package is the headless core used by the VS Code extension, MCP server, and CLI.

## Current Entry Points

- CodeGraphy Workspace paths: resolve `.codegraphy/settings.json` and `.codegraphy/graph.lbug` for any folder path.
- Workspace Settings: read, normalize, write, and fingerprint workspace-local settings, including ordered plugin entries.
- File Discovery: discover analyzable files and directories in any CodeGraphy Workspace without VS Code APIs.
- Tree-sitter Analysis: parse supported languages and produce file, symbol, import, call, inherit, reference, and type-import relationships.
- File Analysis: run cache-aware per-file plugin analysis and project file relationships without VS Code APIs.
- Core Indexing: index an explicit CodeGraphy Workspace path, run headless plugins, build the Relationship Graph, and write the workspace Graph Cache.
- Workspace Analysis: orchestrate discovery, pre-analysis hooks, file analysis, cache updates, and graph rebuilds through headless dependencies.
- Graph Projection: build file, package, folder, and symbol Relationship Graph nodes and edges from analysis results.
- Plugin manifests: read `package.json#codegraphy` metadata without importing plugin runtime code.
- Installed plugin cache: refresh, add, read, and write the user-level `~/.codegraphy/plugins.json` cache.
- Workspace plugin enablement: enable or disable cached plugin packages by writing the workspace-local `plugins` array.
- Graph Cache status: report whether a workspace-local Graph Cache exists without using VS Code APIs.
- Workspace status: report fresh, stale, or missing Graph Cache state with inspectable stale reasons.
- Graph Cache storage: load, save, clear, and inspect the LadybugDB-backed Graph Cache at `<workspace-root>/.codegraphy/graph.lbug`.
- Graph Query: run node, edge, relationship, symbol, and path reports over Relationship Graph data plus persisted analysis metadata.

The core package now exposes `indexCodeGraphyWorkspace` for explicit path-based Indexing. VS Code, MCP, and CLI adapters should call this package instead of owning independent indexing behavior.

## Plugin State Model

Plugin installation and workspace enablement are separate:

- Installed plugins live in the user-level cache at `~/.codegraphy/plugins.json`.
- Enabled plugins live in a CodeGraphy Workspace settings file at `<workspace-root>/.codegraphy/settings.json`.
- New workspaces materialize `@codegraphy/plugin-markdown` as the first enabled plugin during first Indexing.
- The enabled plugin order is the order of the workspace `plugins` array.
- `plugins refresh` scans global npm roots for `@codegraphy/*` packages with CodeGraphy plugin metadata.
- `plugins add <package>` records an explicitly named globally installed package, including non-`@codegraphy` packages.
- Enabling or disabling a plugin changes workspace settings only; plugin runtime loading still waits for explicit Indexing.
- Indexing imports enabled npm plugin packages through their normal package `exports`, merges manifest `defaultOptions` with workspace-local `options`, and delivers the result to plugin lifecycle and analysis hooks as `context.options`.

Plugin npm packages identify themselves with package metadata:

```json
{
  "name": "@codegraphy/plugin-python",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "codegraphy": {
    "type": "plugin",
    "apiVersion": "^2.0.0",
    "defaultOptions": {
      "includeTests": true
    },
    "disclosures": []
  }
}
```
